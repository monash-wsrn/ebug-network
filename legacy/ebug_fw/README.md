Romi robot's processor code is here. Quoting from the Pololu website:
"The Romi 32U4 Control Board is designed to be programmed over USB
from the Arduino IDE. It can be programmed from Windows, Linux, and
Mac OS X. The ATmega32U4 on the control board comes preloaded with the
same USB bootloader as the A-Star 32U4 family of general-purpose
programmable ATmega32U4 boards."
